### Not sure what to do?

It's hard to get started when you're not sure about what to do, so here are some suggestions:

- Try adding a file with your username in the title. For example, my username is *monte9**, so I'd create a file named `monte9.html`.

- Add your username to `human.txt`.

- (:+1: Bonus) Sort the `human.txt`, so the file is in an alphabetical order.

- (:+1: Bonus) Add some fun content to your own file.

### Not sure how to do it?

1. You should **fork** this repository using the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button on the top right, see [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#fork-an-example-repository).
